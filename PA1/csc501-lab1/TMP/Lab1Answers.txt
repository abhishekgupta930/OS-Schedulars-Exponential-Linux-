Ans 1 .
Exponential Distribution scheduler

Pros
1.Easier Implemenation
2.Avoids starvation. Though not very equitably scheduled but low priority process does get scheduled avoiding starvation.

Cons

1. Higher the priority of process, lower is the probability of getting it scheduled which may be not be desirable sometimes.

Linux-like scheduler

Pros
1. Every process gets a definite chance to run during an epoch as per goodness index
2. The process which gets little time in one epoch are more likely to run in next epoch

Cons

1. Space and Time Complexity are higher as comapred to default and exponential distribution scheduler


Xinu Scheduler


Pros
1. Easy Implementatiom
2. Process with higher priority are scheduled first

Cons

1. Low priority process may get completely starved


Ans 2

 
Exponential Distribution scheduler-
Null process is scheduled when there is no other process in ready queue

Xinu scheduler-
Null process is scheduled when there is no other process in ready queue

Linux-like scheduler-
when every process has used it's quanta in given epoch
